**Rainbow Full Elite jadebox details**
 
Normal encounter pool is shared between the stages (parts) of the act.
Meaning, if an elite was encountered on normal node, she won't be encountered again during 'normal battle' for the rest of the act.

Elite node pool was reworked too. It now contains all the elites. 
However, act appropriate elites have higher chance of appearing, 2.1 weight vs 1. 
That makes the chance of encountering a regular act elite on the first visited elite node 57.5%.

 
Out of act elites are strengthened/weakened mostly by scaling max hp or adding/removing firepower. However expect surprises.
